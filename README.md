# üéì College Community Q&A Forum

Hi! I built this app as a personal project to create a modern, student-friendly space for knowledge sharing, asking academic questions, and helping each other with studies. The idea was inspired by the collaborative spirit of my own college campus, aiming to make learning more interactive and accessible for all students.

## üåü Introduction

This Q&A forum lets college students:
- Post academic questions across subjects
- Submit detailed answers to help peers
- Browse questions by topic for easy navigation
- Search questions/answers for quick discovery
- Upvote helpful and clear responses
- Register accounts and track activity
- See answer summaries to cut through long threads  
I wanted to combine a clean look, intuitive navigation, and some fun animations ‚Äî making sure the app feels lively and welcoming.

## üíª Why I Built This Project

During my coursework and group discussions, I noticed the need for a simple, accessible online platform for students to help each other outside class. Building this Q&A forum challenged me to develop skills in:
- App design and user experience
- Authentication and user flows
- Search and content filtering
- Responsive layouts and interactive UI
- Integrating third-party APIs for features like summaries

## üé® Design Choices

- **Colors:** I chose blue, white, and gold to match classic collegiate vibes.
- **Typography:** Used 'Playfair Display' for titles (looks academic) and 'PT Sans' for body text (clean and readable).
- **Icons/Animation:** Added 3D icons for books, hats, and badges, plus subtle 3D animations to enhance interactivity.
- **Layout:** Prioritized neat sections for questions, answers, and topic browsing.
